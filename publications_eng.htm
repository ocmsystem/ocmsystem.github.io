					<p align="justify">This article presents the basic principles of modeling and operation of the mathematical apparatus for assessing of the organization and the product competitiveness within the Organizational competitiveness management system (OCMS). The objectivity of the system mathematical assessment is substantiated, on this ground, In view of the experience  of applying mathematical methods, gained in the process of meeting   economic problems and challenges. This paper also concentrates on  the main critical remarks  and limitations of using a number of well-known mathematical methods of the Management theory, there have been  revealed the differences and advantages of the mathematical apparatus of the Organizational competitiveness management system, on this basis.</p>

					<p align="justify">In this article there has justified the usefulness of the process approach and modelling in the analysis and objective quantification of organisation and products competitiveness within organisation competitiveness management system (OCMS). Particular attention is paid to the interrelation of business processes and performance indicators of the organisation that functioning as a single organisational-economic system; identification and modelling of these interrelations as a function in the development of models for quantitative evaluation of the organisation and products competitiveness. There have been formed the main stages of the assessment and analysis of the organisation and products competitiveness within the OCMS based on the process approach and modelling.</p>

Author’s abstract (2008), <i>In Russian</i>.</p>
					<p align="justify">This investigation of dc into thesis looks into the development of the Russian machinery and works within it in order to set up a number of methods to raise their competitive capacity on basis of economic and technical characteristics of an organisation and the goods it produces. There built up an integrated goods competitiveness indicator and an economic and mathematical model to estimate the competitive capacity of an organisation. Also, it set up methods to introduce a new integrated economic organisational competitiveness management system in to the machinery work JSC Novo-Vyatka. These methods are based on organisation business processes re-engineering, mathematical modelling, and on systems approach. Furthermore, the author proposes and analyses the ways to raise competitiveness management system in the Russian machinery.</p>
